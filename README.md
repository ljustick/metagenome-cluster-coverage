### 1. Identify clusters of interest
The user first needs to identify the gene clusters you are interested in. To calculate the coverage you will need a csv with the following information in the following format. You will need the gene cluster/clusters you are interested in, and the corresponding reference genomes and the gene calller id's that fall within the cluster. 
Example:
| Cluster ID | Genome Name | Gene Caller ID |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 001 | genome1 | GCID |
| 001 | genome2 | GCID |
| ... | ... | ... |
  
This information can be generated using the above Anvi'o pipelines. The pangenomic summary file contains all the required information to create this table.
### 2. Merge summaries together
Matlab function to merge Anvi'o summary files together, all inputs must be strings.
```matlab
merge_anvio_summary(file_type,dir_sumaries_are_in,name)
```
example:
```matlab
merge_anvio_summary("-gene_coverages.txt","SUMMARIES","TEST")
```
This will results in the following. All gene coverage files will be merged into a single file per reference genome found in the directory TEST.
### 3. Sum coverages of genes in clusters of interest
Matlab function to extract gene cluster read coverages, all inputs must be character arrays.
```matlab
cluster_coverage(cluster_file,dataset,output_file)
```
example:
```matlab
cluster_coverage('pro_Fe_nut_clus.csv','TEST','test.csv')
```
this will results in a file named ` test.csv ` with the calculated gene coverages.
